# Points to Noted:

1. Created Presenters inside app/presenters for JSON presentation layer. We can add seperate presenters for Email if requirement is diffrent. I could have used ActiveModel Serializer instead of me creating Presenters, Tried to avoid gems and rails features.

2. Rails app is ready to execute. Please run rails server after downloading. Endpoint: http://localhost:3000/news_feed

3. Covered basic controller testing
